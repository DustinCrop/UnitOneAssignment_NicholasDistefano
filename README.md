* Founders: Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb


# The Origins of Ripple
Ripple's origins date back well beyond the inception of Bitcoin.  In 2004, software engineer Ryan Fugger founded RipplePay, a payment system designed to replace traditional banking with a peer-to-peer trust network. RipplePay.com was launched, and in 2011 on the heels of Bitcoin’s success, Fugger was approached by Jed McCaleb. McCaleb sought to use RipplePay’s network to support his concept for a new digital currency. Fugger sold the company and technology to McCaleb around 2011, who was joined by Chris Larsen and David Schwartz. They took on the company name OpenCoin and got to work developing an updated protocol and the Ripple network, later coined the XRP Ledger. 

Chris Larsen is still onboard at Ripple as Founder/Executive Chair, with David Schwartz as CTO/CoFounder. 
Brad Garlinghouse, who came onboard as COO in 2015, is the  sitting CEO of Ripple. 

# Funding

Ripple has raised roughly $294 Million in funds after 13 rounds. Their most recent funding, a Secondary Market round, occurred on April 3, 2020.

 Following the launch of their currency, Ripple garnered investments from the likes of Google Ventures, IDG Capital Partners, the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund and more, to the tune of $1.5 million. Pressures from these investors allegedly led to the resignation of McCaleb, who is said to have left on less than amicable terms.

# RippleNet & ODL: On-Demand Liquidity
        
Ripple has a few financial obstacles that its technology helps to navigate. Firstly, financial institutions still use decades old technology to settle transactions, a technology whose shortcomings are exacerbated when it comes to settling transactions between parties in different countries. Ripple claims that its technology allows for value to be transferred across the internet much in the same way that information is. The current system used by payment processing companies and banks can take days to complete and charges customers high fees to transact between countries. However, instead of simply utilizing a peer-to-peer blockchain network to instantly process transactions by bypassing banks, Ripple’s xCurrent technology (now called RippleNet) essentially updates the networks used by banks and financial intuitions to allow them to instantly settle transactions via only a single API, while giving them the capability to review these transactions before they are authorized. RippleNet enables these institutions to provide customers with lower fees and faster payment processing, which in turn will draw more customers to choose the services of these institutions.
Ripple’s ODL (On-Demand Liquidity), a service of RippleNet, claims to lessen the amount of liquidity required by payment processing service providers to enter any given market. By using Ripple’s native currency, XRP, service providers do not need to bother with exchanging their own currency to that of their desired market. Since the service provider’s liquidity is in XRP, their funds are readily exchanged for any currency by banks utilizing RippleNet technology. Utilizing an API that allows these service providers, banks, and companies to merge their systems with the RippleNet to send and receive payments, Ripple allows these customers to combine any correlated data with each payment to provide comprehensive transparency to the XRP ledger. 

# Financial Partners & Customers

Ripple has customers ranging from large financial institutions such as Bank of America to creditors and exchanges like American Express and LuLu Exchange, respectively. MoneyGram, a payment firm utilizes the On-Demand Liquidity service provided by RippleNet. Their partnership with international giant Banco Santander demonstrates an irrefutable interest from the enterprise financial sector to provide their customers with an updated and streamlined method of moving value across the world. 
RippleNet relies on partners to utilize their services and XRP to provide liquidity. Currently, with 300+ customers and growing, RippleNet is proving to be a widespread and functional network. 

# Current Landscape: A Federal Roadblock

As it stands, Ripple, Inc. has fallen under tremendous scrutiny by way of federal litigation. Regarding Ripple's prior sales of XRP, the SEC claims the company was dealing in unregistered securities. Ripple argues that the SEC has classified other similar digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as not being securities, and they themselves inquired to the SEC about XRP's security status without receiving any adequate response. Despite any appearance of a strong defense, the lawsuit has caused at least one major partner, MoneyGram, to step away from the company on a surface level. It has also led to most major cryptocurrency exchanges to de-list sales of XRP to US based customers. 
 
# Results

For their goal of instant cross-border payments to be realized, it seems that many more large players in the financial world will need to adopt the services of the XRP and RippleNet technologies. The SEC lawsuit notwithstanding, Ripple still appears to be in a relatively early phase of their roadmap, but at their increasing rate of growth, institutional adoption, and interest surrounding the XRP (barring any regulatory outcome of the ongoing SEC vs Ripple Lawsuit) it doesn’t seem far-fetched to assume that it will not be long before the true value of their technology will become apparent on the consumer scale. Given that the United States Government does not stop them dead in their tracks. In many ways, Ripple is leading the beachhead against federal suppression of blockchain technology in the United States. If the company manages to achieve a favorable outcome for XRP, it could be a turning point in the blockchain biosphere. One that ideally leads to the narrowing down of institutional and retail investor interest towards blockchains with real-world utility and away from the realm of digital snake-oil projects that act as little more than modern proxys of the penny stock firms that swindled untold millions in the past.
