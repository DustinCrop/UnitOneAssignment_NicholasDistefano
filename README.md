### The Origins of Ripple
Ripple's origins date back well beyond the inception of Bitcoin.  In 2004, software engineer Ryan Fugger founded RipplePay, a payment system designed to replace traditional banking with a peer-to-peer trust network. RipplePay.com was eventually launched and in 2011, on the heels of Bitcoin’s success, Fugger was approached by Jed asking to use RipplePay’s network to support a new digital currency. Fugger sold the company and technology to McCaleb around 2011, who was joined by Chris Larsen (Executive Chair) and David Schwartz (Chief Cryptologist_(not to be confused with Cryptozoologist)_). They took on the company name OpenCoin and got to work developing an updated protocol and the Ripple network, later coined the XRP Ledger. Settling on the name Ripple, they began their first round of seed funding. 
Supported by investors Roger Ver and Kraken founder, Jesse Powell in 2012, Ripple had the capital necessary to launch their own digital currency XRP in 2013. Ripple made the decision to mint 100 billion coins, with 20 billion of those controversially allocated to the founders Larsen and McCaleb under a lock-up agreement. Following the launch of their currency, Ripple garnered investments from the likes of Google Ventures, IDG Capital Partners, the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund and more, to the tune of $1.5 million.  Pressures from these investors allegedly led to the resignation of McCaleb, who is said to have left on less than amicable terms. 
Currently, Chris Larsen is still onboard at Ripple as Founder/Executive Chair, with David Schwartz as CTO and CoFounder. Brad Garlinghouse is the sitting CEO, coming onboard as COO in 2015. Garlinghouse reported in 2019 that Ripple had received $200 million in series C funding from partners SBI Ventures, Route 66 Ventures, and Tetragon. 

### RippleNet & ODL: On-Demand Liquidity
        
Ripple has a few financial obstacles that its technology helps to navigate. Firstly, financial institutions still use decades old technology to settle transactions, a technology whose shortcomings are exacerbated when it comes to settling transactions between parties in different countries. Ripple claims that its technology allows for value to be transferred across the internet much in the same way that information is. The current system used by payment processing companies and banks can take days to complete and charges customers high fees to transact between countries. However, instead of simply utilizing a peer-to-peer blockchain network to instantly process transactions by bypassing banks, Ripple’s xCurrent technology (now called RippleNet) essentially updates the networks used by banks and financial intuitions to allow them to instantly settle transactions via only a single API, while giving them the capability to review these transactions before they are authorized. RippleNet enables these institutions to provide customers with lower fees and faster payment processing, which in turn will draw more customers to choose the services of these institutions.
Ripple’s ODL (On-Demand Liquidity), a service of RippleNet, claims to lessen the amount of liquidity required by payment processing service providers to enter any given market. By using Ripple’s native currency, XRP, service providers do not need to bother with exchanging their own currency to that of their desired market. Since the service provider’s liquidity is in XRP, their funds are readily exchanged for any currency by banks utilizing RippleNet technology. Utilizing an API that allows these service providers, banks, and companies to merge their systems with the RippleNet to send and receive payments, Ripple allows these customers to combine any correlated data with each payment to provide comprehensive transparency to the XRP ledger. 

### Financial Partners & Customers

Ripple has customers ranging from large financial institutions such as Bank of America to creditors and exchanges like American Express and LuLu Exchange, respectively. MoneyGram, a payment firm utilizes the On-Demand Liquidity service provided by RippleNet. Their partnership with international giant Banco Santander demonstrates an irrefutable interest from the enterprise financial sector to provide their customers with an updated and streamlined method of moving value across the world. 
RippleNet relies on partners to utilize their services and XRP to provide liquidity. Currently, with 300+ customers and growing, RippleNet is proving to be a widespread and functional network. However, for their goal of instant cross-border payments to be realized, it seems that many more large players in the financial world will need to adopt the services of the XRP and RippleNet technologies.  Ripple still appears to be in an early phase of their roadmap, but at their increasing rate of growth, institutional adoption, and interest surrounding the XRP (barring any regulatory outcome of the ongoing SEC vs Ripple Lawsuit) it doesn’t seem far-fetched to assume that it will not be long before the true value of their technology will become apparent on the consumer scale.
